Hypixel Files
Repository of mods & autohotkey scripts I have compiled to be used with Hypixel. These are mods that I personally find useful. Let me know if you have any more suggestions. Below is a list of mods and AHK scripts/compiled exe files. 

## AHK/EXE
The following scripts are in these folders:
Script | Purpose
---------|-----------
anti-AFK | When program is active, use hotkey `<WIN + Z>` to both start and stop a script that inputs default movement keys (WASD) to stop the AFK timer
AT Stats | Designed to work with the mod [Autotip](https://github.com/yarnie13/hypixel/blob/main/mods/Autotip-3.0.1%20%5B1.8-1.12.2%5D.jar). When installed, use hotkey `<WIN + N>` to automatically input the command to view statistics for AutoTip mod
Lobby | WIP - Don't use yet

## MODS
The following mods are in the folder
Script | Purpose
---------|-----------
5zig Reborn | This mod allows you to add useful HUD overlays. **Disclaimer: While mods such as HUD Overlays are allowed on Hypixel, 5zig includes features such as macros which are a punishable offence** 
AutoGG | Automatically types "gg" in chat at the end of a game
Optifine | Adds a zoom feature, adds more customisable graphics settings, reduces lag. *Note: Optifine can be run without Forge* 
Quickplay | Press hotkey `<RShift>` to show a menu used to easily navigate directly into a desired game
Vanilla Enhancements | See [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanilla-enhancements) for more information  
Chat triggers | See [ChatTriggers page](https://www.chattriggers.com/) for more information
